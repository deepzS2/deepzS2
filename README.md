### ðŸ‘‹ "Boa noite!" ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to deepzS2 Github!

I'm a Full Stack Developer with experience in **DevOps**, **Game Development**, and **UI/UX Design**.

My favorite language to work with is **JavaScript/TypeScript**, but I'm also interested in expanding my knowledge with other languages like C++, Golang, Elixir, and more.

I began learning development in 2019, starting with **C** and quickly falling in love with **JavaScript**. Since then, I've been studying web development and more. Currently, I have a lot of experience with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and its potential for creating full-stack websites using frameworks/libraries like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). However, when I started exploring **Game Development**, C# quickly became my second favorite language. This led me to study the .NET Framework to develop APIs and concepts/patterns like the Repository Pattern, DDD (Domain Driven Design), SOLID, etc., which I hadn't encountered before with **Node.js**.

Here are a few things to know about me:

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently looking for **employment opportunities**;
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning **Azure** and **Game Development**;
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me anything about games, programming, design, and more.
