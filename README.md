### ðŸ‘‹ "Boa noite!" ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to deepzS2 github,
I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with a little knowledge about **DevOps**, **Game Developer** and **UI/UX design**.

The language I love to develop is **JavaScript/TypeScript**, but I'm looking forward to learn another languages like **C++**, **Golang**, **Elixir**, etc...

I started learning development since 2019, my first language was C and my first passion by a language was JavaScript, since then I started to learn Web Development and a lot more. Today I learned a lot about Node.js and his possibilities to make a FullStack website with one frameword/library like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). But when I started to look deep into **Game Development**, C# was my new favorite language, making me study .NET Framework for developing APIs and concepts/patterns such as like Repository Pattern, DDD (Domain Driven Design), SOLID, etc., which in Node.js I never saw about.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently unemployed;
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS, Azure and Game Development;
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about games, programming, design, etc.

### My knowledge
And I'll still learning more about the crazy world of programming!
